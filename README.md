# Final-Presentation

This presentation uses data from Wave 116 of the American Trends Project, which can be found on the Pew Research Center website (https://www.pewresearch.org/datasets/). 

I wanted to explore potential partisan differences in Americans' views on foreign policy. The presentation includes graphs with respondent answers to two questions:

    - Should the U.S. pursue policies to maintain military supremacy?
    - Should the U.S. take allies interests' into account, or always pursure         its own interests?

For both questions, I divided respondents by party preference. For the allies question, I also divded Republicans into two groups: Trump Approval and Trump Disapproval. I created these additional subgroups by using respondent ratings of their feelings towards Trump (<50 = disapproval, >50 = approval).
